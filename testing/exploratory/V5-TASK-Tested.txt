V5-TASK-01 — UI verification
1. Opened the website as a visitor (not logged in).
2. Navigated to the product listing page.
3. Checkedt the limited cart UI is displayed for visitors.
4. Verified that the UI reacts correctly when a visitor tries to add/remove items.
5. Confirmed that no login or account creation was required to interact with the limited cart.

Everything displayed correctly and behaved as expected.

V5-TASK-02 — Session-based limited cart logic
1. Added several products to the limited cart while not logged in.
2. Refreshed the page to confirm the session items persisted temporarily.
3. Removed items one-by-one to verify state updates correctly.
4. Closed the browser tab and reopened it to confirm behavior resets properly (session storage).
5. Checked console logs and network requests — no unexpected errors.

The add/remove behavior worked correctly and matched the expected session logic.

V5-TASK-03 — Session cart behavior

Team members previously mentioned that refreshing the page causes an error with temporary cart items.

1. Added multiple items to the temporary cart as a visitor.
2. Refreshed the page several times while observing console logs.
3. Navigated between pages (home → product → cart → product).
4. Cleared the session manually and repeated the test.
5. Created a new account to see if temporary items transfer to the user cart after registration.

I was not able to reproduce the page-refresh error.
I will continue checking edge cases, but so far I cannot recreate the issue.
